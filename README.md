My project utilizes Fortune 1000 data from 2018 found on Kaggle, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/Eruditepanda/fortune-1000-2018). I chose to subset this dataset to focus on the more widely-recognized Fortune 500.

The Fortune 500 list is compiled by Fortune Magazine by ranking public and private US companies by their total revenue for the fiscal year.

The [app](https://stellakim.shinyapps.io/fortune500/) that I created can be used as a comprehensive and comparative tool, to see how two categories (i.e companies, sectors, states) stack up against each other by different metrics.

I also included a tab highlighting female CEOs on the 2018 Fortune 500 list. Women make up half the population and should make up half the workforce, not 5% (I'm looking at you Fortune 500, but this is a pervasive issue that occurs in all facets of life). Let's do better! :)
